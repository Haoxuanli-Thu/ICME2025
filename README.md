### Our Network & FRLoss
1. Our network and other networks are located in: nnUNet/nnunetv2/nnUNetTrainer/variants/network_architecture
2. The path of the loss in: nnUNet/nnunetv2/training/loss/compound_losses.py
### Private Dataset
We will later open-source our used dataset, which is a large DCE-MRI breast cancer dataset. We believe this will facilitate the development of related works.

### Public Dataset

### About ckpt and prediction of Public Dataset

Due to the storage space of all the checkpoints and prediction results, we will open source all the files after the paper is accepted
